## SPATIAL VISUALIZATION WITH PYTHON

**Geospatial analysis** is taking on an ever more important role in the industry.
`Folium` is a Python library used for visualizing geospatial data. It is easy to use and yet a powerful library. 
The `Folium` library in Python helps us analyze the location and geospatial data with ease and lets us create interactive maps. 

**The idea of the project is to use the functionalities of folium and plot volcanoes positions on the map rendered by folium.**
